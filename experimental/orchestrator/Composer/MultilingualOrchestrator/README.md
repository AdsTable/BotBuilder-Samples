# Multilingual Orchestrator Sample

The following sample illustrates how Orchestrator works with multilingual bots. Supported languages depend on the multilingual Orchestrator base model being used. Please refer to the [Base Models][1]  documentation for supported languages.

The sample simply illustrates how Orchestrator is seamlessly integrated into Composer and how it performs on a subset of supported languages.
